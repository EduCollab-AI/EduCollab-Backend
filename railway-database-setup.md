# Railway Database Setup (Alternative)

If you want to use Railway's PostgreSQL instead of Supabase:

## 1. Add Railway PostgreSQL
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Copy connection details

## 2. Update application.yml
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://${DATABASE_URL}
    username: ${DATABASE_USER}
    password: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
```

## 3. Implement Authentication
You'll need to implement your own auth system:
- JWT token generation
- Password hashing
- User registration/login
- Session management

## 4. Add Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- API rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Input validation

## 5. Create Admin Interface
- Database management tools
- User management
- Analytics dashboard

## 6. Migration from Supabase
- Export data from Supabase
- Import to Railway PostgreSQL
- Update Flutter app endpoints
- Test all functionality

## Pros of Railway Database
- Single platform
- Potentially cheaper
- Full control

## Cons of Railway Database
- More development work
- No built-in auth
- No real-time features
- No admin dashboard
- Need to implement everything manually
